# Map Access Issue - Complete Solution

## Problem Summary

You're getting this error when trying to access the map:
```
java.lang.IllegalAccessError: superclass access check failed: class com.sun.javafx.sg.prism.web.NGWebView (in unnamed module @0x4b43438) cannot access class com.sun.javafx.sg.prism.NGGroup (in module javafx.graphics) because module javafx.graphics does not export com.sun.javafx.sg.prism to unnamed module @0x4b43438
```

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Java Version Mismatch**: Your classes were compiled with Java 17+ but you're running Java 8
2. **JavaFX Version Conflict**: You have JavaFX 21.0.7 installed, but the application expects JavaFX 8
3. **Module System Restrictions**: JavaFX 21 has stricter module access controls

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Install Java 17+ and Use Maven (Recommended)

**Best for**: Full functionality with interactive maps

1. **Download Java 17+**:
   - Go to: https://adoptium.net/
   - Download Java 17 or higher
   - Install and add to PATH

2. **Download Maven**:
   - Go to: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
   - Download Maven
   - Extract and add to PATH

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   build.bat
   run.bat
   ```

### Option 2: Use Java 8 with Text-Based Map (Quick Fix)

**Best for**: Immediate access without installing new software

1. **Recompile with Java 8**:
   ```bash
   build_java8.bat
   ```

2. **Run with Java 8**:
   ```bash
   run_java8.bat
   ```

3. **Map functionality**: Will show a text-based location view instead of interactive map

### Option 3: Use Existing Classes with Java 17+ (If Available)

**Best for**: If you have Java 17+ installed but not in PATH

1. **Try the smart launcher**:
   ```bash
   run_with_javafx.bat
   ```

2. **This script will**:
   - Search for Java 17+ installations
   - Use proper module flags
   - Fall back to Java 8 if needed

## Current System Status

- **Java Runtime**: Java 8 (OpenJDK)
- **JavaFX**: JavaFX 21.0.7 SDK installed
- **Compiled Classes**: Java 17+ bytecode
- **Issue**: Version mismatch causing WebView access failure

## Immediate Workaround

If you need to access the map right now:

1. **The application will automatically fallback** to a text-based map view
2. **You'll see**: A list of missing persons with their locations
3. **Format**: 
   ```
   üî¥ John Doe - Dhaka, Bangladesh
   üü¢ Jane Smith - Chittagong, Bangladesh
   ```

## Step-by-Step Fix

### For Full Map Functionality:

1. **Install Java 17+**:
   - Download from https://adoptium.net/
   - Install and restart your computer

2. **Install Maven**:
   - Download from https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
   - Extract to C:\Program Files\Apache\maven
   - Add C:\Program Files\Apache\maven\bin to PATH

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   build.bat
   run.bat
   ```

### For Quick Access:

1. **Use the Java 8 approach**:
   ```bash
   build_java8.bat
   run_java8.bat
   ```

2. **Map will show as text list** instead of interactive map

## What Each Script Does

- **`build.bat`**: Uses Maven to build with JavaFX 21 and proper module flags
- **`run.bat`**: Runs with JavaFX 21 and module access flags
- **`build_java8.bat`**: Compiles with Java 8 compatibility
- **`run_java8.bat`**: Runs with Java 8 (text-based map)
- **`run_with_javafx.bat`**: Smart launcher that finds the best Java version
- **`run_simple.bat`**: Simple fallback for basic functionality

## Expected Results

### With Java 17+ and Maven:
- ‚úÖ Interactive web-based map
- ‚úÖ Clickable markers
- ‚úÖ Full map functionality

### With Java 8:
- ‚úÖ Text-based location view
- ‚úÖ All other functionality works
- ‚ùå No interactive map

### Automatic Fallback:
- ‚úÖ Application starts normally
- ‚úÖ Map shows as text list
- ‚úÖ No crashes or errors

## Troubleshooting

### If you get "Maven not found":
- Download Maven from https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
- Add to PATH environment variable

### If you get "Java 17+ not found":
- Download Java 17+ from https://adoptium.net/
- Add to PATH environment variable

### If the map still doesn't work:
- The text-based fallback will activate automatically
- You'll see a list of missing persons with their locations

### If you get compilation errors:
- Make sure you have the latest code
- Try running the scripts as administrator
- Check that all dependencies are downloaded

## Benefits of Each Approach

### Java 17+ with Maven:
- ‚úÖ Full interactive map functionality
- ‚úÖ Modern Java features
- ‚úÖ Future-proof
- ‚ùå Requires installation of new software

### Java 8 Approach:
- ‚úÖ Works with existing setup
- ‚úÖ No new software needed
- ‚úÖ Quick to implement
- ‚ùå Limited map functionality (text-only)

The application is designed to handle these issues gracefully, so you'll always get a functional map view regardless of your Java setup.
